Project Reflection

AI Tools Used
For this project, I used ChatGPT as my primary support tool while building a simple Python program that can understand and interpret weather-related questions written in plain English. ChatGPT helped guide me through the full development process, from brainstorming how to start, to structuring the code, refining logic, simplifying syntax, and troubleshooting errors. One of the most helpful aspects of using ChatGPT was how quickly I could ask a question, receive an answer, and immediately test it. I could explore different solutions to the same problem in real time, which made the learning experience interactive and flexible. I did not use other tools like GitHub Copilot for this project, but I see how using ChatGPT in combination with other AI tools could make the process even more efficient, especially for more advanced applications.

Prompting Techniques
I used prompting techniques that were conversational and goal-driven. I started with open-ended prompts like asking how to parse weather questions in Python. After receiving a sample response, I continued asking more targeted follow-up questions. I often asked things like “Can you simplify this code?”, “Why doesn’t this work?”, or “Can you give an example?” These types of prompts helped me understand not just what the solution was, but also how and why it worked. When a version of the code didn’t work the way I expected, I described the problem clearly and asked for alternatives. This process of asking, testing, and refining continued until I had a version of the code that made sense and worked well for the goal I had in mind.

What Worked Well
I am proud of how I was able to take a basic idea and turn it into a working piece of software using a clear, structured approach. I started with a general problem of understanding natural language questions about the weather, and I broke it down into smaller steps with the help of ChatGPT. I created a function that can identify the main parts of a question such as the location, the time period, and the weather topic. I feel that the final version of the code is both simple and effective. It is something I can understand, explain to others, and build on later. I also appreciated how flexible the development process was. I was able to experiment with different ideas without being afraid of making mistakes, because I could always go back and ask for help. This gave me confidence and kept the project enjoyable.

What Would You Do Differently
If I had more time or resources, there are several things I would do to improve and expand this project. One major improvement would be to connect the program to a real weather API so it could actually answer the user’s question with live weather information. That would make the tool not just a parser, but a full weather assistant. I would also upgrade the language detection part by using a natural language processing library like spaCy or a pretrained model that can better understand more complex or casual questions. For example, phrases like “later today” or “is it going to be chilly” are harder for simple code to detect correctly. Using a more advanced NLP approach would help with that. I would also like to improve the way the program handles missing information. Right now, if a user leaves out a location or time, it might not respond clearly. A future version could ask the user to clarify what they meant. Finally, I would consider turning the tool into a small web app or mobile app with a user interface, so that people without coding experience could use it easily.

Final Thoughts
Working on this project has been a valuable learning experience. It showed me how much can be achieved with a combination of clear thinking, consistent effort, and support from AI tools like ChatGPT. I was able to apply my Python knowledge in a practical and creative way, while also learning more about how language and programming can work together. I developed a better understanding of how to extract meaning from natural language and how to write functions that can interpret and organize information from real questions. This project also helped me grow more confident in my ability to break down complex tasks into manageable steps. ChatGPT was not just a tool that gave me answers, it was a partner that encouraged me to learn more, test ideas, and improve my thinking. I now feel more comfortable working on projects that involve both text and logic, and I’m excited to continue exploring how AI can help support learning and creativity in the future.
